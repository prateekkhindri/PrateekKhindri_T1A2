## **Description**

### **Purpose**

My website's primary goal is to promote my skills and attract future employers. I wanted to create an aesthetically appealing and user-friendly website. I also wanted to make sure that my website was viewable on mobile devices, as I know that this is a growing way for people to access the internet. I made my own portfolio website for a variety of reasons, primarily to showcase my work to future prospective employers or clients and also to interact with other like minded individuals.

### **Functionality / Features**

The website is divided into 5 individual pages. The homepage `home.html` includes a summary of my qualifications, experience, and education. Furthermore, the homepage links to each individual page on the website to improve the user experience. Each page has a header and a footer that includes links to Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub. The project website includes a live demo as well as source code links to some of my previous work. The `contact page` includes my contact information as well as a static form.

- The website functions well on all devices, from desktop computers to cellphones, thanks to its **_responsive design_**.

- Visitors may find what they're seeking for fast and simply thanks to clear and **_intuitive navigation_**.

- On the home and about pages, there are **_resume download_** options.

- For tablet and mobile displays, the website features a **_hamburger-style_** sidemenu.

- All pages have been **_consistently styled_**, including components, colors, and fonts.

Hiring managers, fellow developers, and potential clients are the intended audience for my personal portfolio website. The website highlights my developer talents, expertise, and projects.
